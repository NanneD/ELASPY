RUNNING_TIME_FILE_NAME
======================

If ``SAVE_OUTPUT=True``, a CSV file is generated where each row represents the running time of one simulation run in seconds. The file is named according to the variable ``RUNNING_TIME_FILE_NAME``. In the example below, the first simulation run took 0.212 seconds, the second 0.251 seconds and the third 0.243 seconds.

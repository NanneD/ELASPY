Advanced plotting
=================

The package comes with several advanced plotting scripts, besides the standard plots the simulator can also provide. These scripts are purely optional, but they can be used to make more complex visuals of the simulation output. These scripts were also used to create the visuals of the paper by Dieleman and Jagtenberg. The scripts are explained in separate sections named according to the scripts.
